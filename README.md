# Microverse Capstone Project

> This project is the Final capstone project of the first module at microverse. It is aim at building responsive UI of an online website for a conference, so in this project I built the home and the about page of the conference page (and readable) on all screens.
The template I used to create this template was originally designed by [Cindy Shin in Behance.](https://www.behance.net/adagio07)
